**HackPack Project Description**

    We wanted to create a educational environment for people that interested in competitive programming and wants to
    improve skills about it.

    We also provide a social environment to our user. Users can discuss about problems and vote others opinion. Also we
    have a message service that can users can communicate other users privately.

    We have contests and problems for the users that they can improve themselves and they can compare themselves to
    other users.

    Users can have teams and attend to the contests as a team.

    We will notify you with notifications when the contests added and starts.

    With the tags of the problems you can improve your weak subjects in competitive programming.
